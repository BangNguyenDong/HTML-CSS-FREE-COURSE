HTML+CSS Tutorial
=================

### Who

I'm Bang Nguyen. I'm a engineer and I've been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and other web development and scripting for over 5 years.
And I want to teach you now.
Because you're good looking.
And because it's useful.
### What

In this tutorial, we'll start from the very beginning.  You don't need to know anything about HTML and CSS or anything about code to start.  I'll include some tutorial files for you to play with and check out.

### When

Now.  Or whenever.  I'm not planning on taking this down anytime soon.  But you are only limited by your own schedule.  Or set free by it.  Whatever.

### Where

On a computer.  Here.

### Why

Because this stuff is important.  Whether you're a business person formatting your emails, an aspiring web designer wanting to get your feet wet, or just someone who is interested and hasn't tried any sort of coding, scripting, or programming before, **HTML and CSS are an essential part** of your learning curve.
