HTML+CSS Tutorial
=================

### Who

I'm Bang Nguyen. I'm a engineer and I've been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and other web development and scripting for over 5 years.
And I want to teach you now.
Because you're good looking.
And because it's useful.
### What

In this tutorial, we'll start from the very beginning.  You don't need to know anything about HTML and CSS or anything about code to start.  I'll include some tutorial files for you to play with and check out.

### When

Now.  Or whenever.  I'm not planning on taking this down anytime soon.  But you are only limited by your own schedule.  Or set free by it.  Whatever.

### Where

On a computer.  Here.

### Why

Because this stuff is important.  Whether you're a business person formatting your emails, an aspiring web designer wanting to get your feet wet, or just someone who is interested and hasn't tried any sort of coding, scripting, or programming before, **HTML and CSS are an essential part** of your learning curve.

### Editors

So the first thing you'll need is an editor to edit your jazz.  There's tons of options out there.

 * Notepad/TextEdit (that's right, the stupid thing that comes on your computer) - This is about as basic as you can get. It's totally okay if you want to use this, but I recommend one of the editors below just so you can see code highlighting (which will help you out later on). But, if you want to be a purist, this'll work just fine.
 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is what I typically use. It's open source and has TONS of extensions available.
 * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - This is a pretty popular option. Very clean interface.
 * [CodePen Projects](https://codepen.io/project) - This is an in-browser code editor, so you can code directly within the web browser, no downloads required. :)
 * [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) - This is another in-browser code editor. It is meant for larger projects, but it's nice to not have to download anything!
 * [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - This is just one step up from Notepad. But it's pretty dece.  Code highlighting is in it, and nothing else too fancy, which is what I like about it.

There's a bunch of others [listed here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors), I just listed the ones I've used and liked!

### Extension for Visual studio code
1. Code Runner
2. Live Server
3. Live Preview
4. Auto Rename Tag
5. Highlight Matching Tag
6. HTML CSS Support

### HTML Tag Structure

Here is a barebones HTML page, about as simple as you can get. You can open it up in the **1 - Structure** folder in the file part1.html. If you were to open the file in your favorite browser (which you can do, go ahead), you'll see a plain webpage with the title "My Website" and the words, "Hello, World!" written on the page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
	
</body>
</html>
```
