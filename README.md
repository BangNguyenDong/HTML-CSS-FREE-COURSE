HTML+CSS Tutorial
=================

Hi, I'm Bang Nguyen. I'm a engineer and I've been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and other web development and scripting for over 5 years.
And I want to teach you now.
Because you're good looking.
And because it's useful.

### Editors

So the first thing you'll need is an editor to edit your jazz.  There's tons of options out there.

 * Notepad/TextEdit (that's right, the stupid thing that comes on your computer) - This is about as basic as you can get. It's totally okay if you want to use this, but I recommend one of the editors below just so you can see code highlighting (which will help you out later on). But, if you want to be a purist, this'll work just fine.
 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is what I typically use. It's open source and has TONS of extensions available.
 * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - This is a pretty popular option. Very clean interface.
 * [CodePen Projects](https://codepen.io/project) - This is an in-browser code editor, so you can code directly within the web browser, no downloads required. :)
 * [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) - This is another in-browser code editor. It is meant for larger projects, but it's nice to not have to download anything!
 * [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - This is just one step up from Notepad. But it's pretty dece.  Code highlighting is in it, and nothing else too fancy, which is what I like about it.

There's a bunch of others [listed here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors), I just listed the ones I've used and liked!

### Extension for Visual studio code
1. Code Runner
2. Live Server
3. Live Preview
4. Auto Rename Tag
5. Highlight Matching Tag
6. HTML CSS Support

###You can find html/css documentation on the following pages:
 * [HTML Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
 * [CSS Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
 * [HTML Dog Tag List](https://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/)

###What is HTML?
1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
2. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
3. HTML describes the structure of a Web page
4. HTML consists of a series of elements
5. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
6. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


### HTML Tag Structure

Here is a barebones HTML page, about as simple as you can get. You can open it up in the **1 - Structure** folder in the file part1.html. If you were to open the file in your favorite browser (which you can do, go ahead), you'll see a plain webpage with the title "My Website" and the words, "Hello, World!" written on the page. <br>

You can create this basic structure with the command !+tab or html:5 on an html page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
	
</body>
</html>
```

###HOW TO CREATE A WEB PAGE
To create a true HTML document you will start with three container elements:
```
<html>
<head>
<body>
```
<br>
These three combine to describe the basic structure of the page:
<br>
<html>: This element wraps all the content of the page (except the DTD) <br>
<head>: This element designates the header part of the document. You can include optional information about the Web page, such as the title (the browser shows it in the title bar), optional search keywords and an optional style sheet <br>
<body>: This element contains the content of your Web page, that is, what we want to appear in the navigation area of the browser <br>
